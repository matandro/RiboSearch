# Purine riboswitch family dossier
This folder contains additional information on the purine riboswitch candidates in my PhD thesis.   
The three families are as such:   
5.4.3  Eukaryote transketolase candidate - transketolase*   
5.4.4  Eukaryote myosin IX candidate - myois*   
5.4.5  Eukaryote mammalian candidate - mammalia*   

Each family has the following files:
- *.cm - The covarience model file for the family, can be used by Infernal
- *.sto - An alignment file in stockholm format generated by cmalign
- *.r2r.svg - An R2R generated image of the family
- *_members.txt - A tubular file containing information about the member sequences of the familiy. It includes matched location, sequence, structure based on alignment and much more
- *_all_annotations.txt - A tubular file containing information about all the nearby and overlapping annotations to each of the matches. We only include information on annotations that are in the same direction.
